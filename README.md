This Weather Forecast API project is  built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON. It provides users with real-time weather information by retrieving data from an external weather API.
Users can enter a city name into the application, which then fetches current weather details that is temperature and weather description. The HTML sets up the structure of the application,
CSS handles the styling and ensures a responsive design, and JavaScript manages the interaction with the weather API. JSON is used to format and process the weather data received from the API, 
which is then displayed dynamically on the web page.
